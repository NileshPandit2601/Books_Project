## Book Data Scraper, SQL Analysis & Visualization
Scraping book data from [Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com/).


## Overview:
This project covering three major phases: Web Scraping, SQL Data Analysis, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Visualization. The dataset is obtained from Books to Scrape, The data includes essential information about books such as title, price, availability, and user ratings.

## Objective:

-- Web Scraping:

Extract meaningful data (title, price, availability, and rating) from all pages of the website using Python libraries such as requests, BeautifulSoup, or Scrapy.

Store the data in a structured format (CSV).

-- SQL Insights:

Load the CSV data into a SQL database.

Run analytical SQL queries to gain insights such as the number of books in stock, the most expensive books, and the distribution of ratings.

-- Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization:

Perform EDA using Pandas to understand the basic structure and distribution of the dataset.

Create meaningful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent key metrics like price distribution, stock availability, and rating counts.


## Dependencies:
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries: pandas, requests, BeautifulSoup, matplotlib, seaborn and others as required.

SQL Database: MySQL Workbench (or a similar database) for running SQL queries.


## Sample Outputs
-- Number of books in stock

-- Top 5 most expensive books

-- Average rating of all books

-- Total number of books for each rating.

-- Charts: rating distribution, price histogram, stock pie chart
